Welcome to one of my many creative spaces. I am currently writing my master's thesis at the IT University of Copenhagen in Digital Design and Interactive technologies. According to plan, I'll be standing with my diploma this summer and a full-time job.

Besides academia, I work at the Danish Technological Institute as a student assistant, writing Python scripts to automate processes regarding data visualization and database management. Moreover, I also have a second part-time job at my university as a teaching assistant in physical Physical Computing, helping other students get started on the Arduino platform.

## What do I like to make?
I have always been very technically minded and have recently found quite an interest in programming and prototyping.  My interests have led me to develop skills in graphic design, mechatronics, and the overall production of digital and physical artifacts. In addition, I also like to learn from myself, and very much want to
share my knowledge if there should be interest in it.

I believe heavily in open-source software and use it myself whenever I can. For my own projects, I publish my code here for full availability to encourage others to develop further or gather inspiration for their own projects. While it’s not my core competence, it’s an aspect of my design process I quite enjoy.
