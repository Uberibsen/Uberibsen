Welcome to one of my many creative spaces. Privately, I use this space to keep track of my code-based hobby projects as well as sharing them with others. These often includes physical prototypes on the Arduino/Raspberry Pi platform as well as standalone, dataprocessing projects.

Professionally, I work as an advanced IT system tester for the Danish State Railways (DSB) where I do quality assurance for onboard systems on the active fleet of trains.

## Who am I generally?
I have always been very technically minded and have recently found quite an interest in programming and prototyping.  My interests have led me to develop skills in graphic design, mechatronics, and the overall production of digital and physical artifacts. In addition, I also like to learn from myself, and very much want to
share my knowledge if there should be interest in it.
