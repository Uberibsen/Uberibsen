    Hello there, I'm Jonas! ðŸ‘‹
</h1>

<p align='center'>
    Welcome to one of my many creative spaces. I am studying my final year in
    <a href=https://en.itu.dk/Programmes/MSc-Programmes/Digital-Design-and-Interactive-Technologies">Digital Design and Interactive Technologies</a> at the
    <a href="https://en.itu.dk/">IT-University of Copenhagen</a>.
</p>

<p align = 'center'>
    I also work at the <a href = "https://www.teknologisk.dk/">Danish Technological Institute</a>, as a student assistant, writing Python scripts to automate  processes regarding data visualizaiton and database management. I have also worked as a teaching assistant at my university in <a href = "https://learnit.itu.dk/local/coursebase/view.php?ciid=550&s=ft"> Physical Computing</a>, helping other students getting started on the Arduino platform.
</p>

    I have always been very technically minded and have recently found quite the interest in programming. For my projects, I tend to lean towards a tangible goal, typically with a physical product.
